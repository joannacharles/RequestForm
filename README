# My Project

## Project Overview
This project is a web application built with .NET for the backend and Angular for the frontend. It allows users to submit support requests and view them.

## Prerequisites
- .NET SDK version 7.0.305
- Node.js version 18.13.0
- Angular CLI version 17.3.8


### Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/joannacharles/RequestForm


### Setup Instructions
cd RequestForm/API
dotnet restore
cd ../client
npm install
 

### Run the application
Run the server:
cd ../API
dotnet watch run

This command starts the .NET server and watches for changes.


Run the client:
cd ../client
ng serve
This command starts the Angular development server.

### Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:4200/


### Notes:
Ensure you have the correct versions of .NET SDK, Node.js, and Angular CLI installed as specified in the prerequisites.
Replace joannacharles/RequestForm with your actual repository URL.
Make sure to run dotnet restore and npm install in their respective directories (API for .NET and client for Angular).
Use dotnet watch run to automatically restart the .NET server on code changes.
Use ng serve to run the Angular development server for live-reloading during development.
This setup guide should help you get your .NET and Angular web application running locally. If you have any further questions or need assistance with any part of the setup, feel free to ask!
